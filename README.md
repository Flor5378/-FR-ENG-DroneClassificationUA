#  Military Drone Classification Project – Ukraine Context

##  Context
In the context of modern warfare, the use of military drones in Ukraine has become a major strategic factor. This project focuses on applying **Machine Learning** to classify various types of drones—whether used for **reconnaissance** or as **weapons of destruction**. The ability to differentiate drones in **real time** enhances the effectiveness of countermeasures against enemy strategies.

##  Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques—particularly the **Random Forest** algorithm—to classify drone trajectories based on their type and purpose. The classifier aims to determine whether a drone is a reconnaissance tool or an active threat.

##  Project Workflow

### 1. **OSINT Phase** (Open Source Intelligence)
- Collect geographic coordinates of Russian drone bases.
- Gather technical specifications of Russian and Ukrainian drone models.

### 2. **Data Generation**
- Simulate a dataset of **1,000 randomly generated drone trajectories**.

### 3. **Machine Learning Classification**
- Train a **Random Forest** model to classify drone trajectories based on their features and origin.

### 4. **Results & Evaluation**
- Compare the model's predictions with real-world labels to evaluate performance.
